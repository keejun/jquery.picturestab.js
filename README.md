this plugin is easy to be applyed for some web applications . first, you should replace the Jquery plugin before picturestab.js ,then follow the example index.html which offers amounts of effections .
eg: $("#imagetoeffect").picturestab("#currimage","clearly"); 
$("#imagetoeffect") refers to the undo image , the "#currimage" refers to the effected image , "clearly" refers to a effection .  you counld find more effections in the index.html in this repository .  remind to place the image src in the undo image tag.
